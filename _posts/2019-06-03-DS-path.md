# Learning path to be Good Data Scientist in 2019
*Tldr; "When i was 21, after 3 years worked as software developer, i decided to learn machine learning and just quit job then apply in a research intern position. There are many reasons to explain my decision but the most and biggest reason (i think) is i was attractive by this - hot keywork "AI - artiffacial intelligent" or "Data scientist - the most sexiest job of 21th century"... Althought i think my decision is too frivolity (or may be careless, of course "opportunity cost"), i think i'm young too and have enough time to repair (wrong). Excerpt from my farvourite quote: "Before turning 25, there are no mistakes or failures, only lessons". But, in my progress i jump form software to academic, i feel i interested in my recent work more."*
