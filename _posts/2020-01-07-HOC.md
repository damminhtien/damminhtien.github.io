In office website of ReactJS introduce a pattern called High Order Component (HOC for short). A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from Reactâ€™s compositional nature.

**Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional functions.**

Higher order components, in general, are a functional programming methodology. If you are familiar with Redux, you surely use **connect**() function look like:
```javascript
import {connect} from 'react-redux';
// code
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(ExampleComponent);
```
**connect** is a HOC. This post aims to describe what is HOC and how it works.
