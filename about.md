### I am Dam Minh Tien. 

I am a young and fabulous engineer at Viettel R&D. My focus field is on System Development: machine learning application, web service, database, docker, system analysis and design.

2018, I and my colleague launched BKFA - a share knowledge platform.

2019, I graduated from Hanoi University with an excellent degree on Information Technology.

Best regard.
